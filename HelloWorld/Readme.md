# Readme - Code Samples for Chapter 1, .NET Application Architectures

To build and run the source code from Chapter 1, you need to install the .NET Core Command Line (CLI) Tools.
Please download and install the tools from [.NET Core downloads](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core#windows). You will find an installer for Visual Studio, and also a .NET Core SDK Installer that just includes the SDK with the command line tools.
 
The current version of this sample is built with .NET Core 1.0 using preview 1 of the tools. With updates of the tools, the sample project will be updated.
