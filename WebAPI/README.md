# Readme - Code Samples for Chapter 42, ASP.NET Web API

This chapter contains these samples:

* Book Service Sample (offering in-memory data from a Web API service using ASP.NET Core)
* Book Service Async Sample (similar to the Book Service Sample, but offering async methods from the controller and use Entity Framework Core 1.0 )
* Book Service Client App (making use of the HttpClient and JSON.NET to access the Web API services)
* OData Samples (upcoming)

The Book Service Sample makes use of Swagger (Swashbuckle 6.0.0-beta901) that is compatible with .NET Core 1.0 RTM and available on NuGet.
The OData Library for .NET Core 1.0 RTM is not yet available. Code will be updated when the library is available on NuGet. [See](https://github.com/OData/WebApi/tree/vNext/vNext "OData WebAPI")

The current version of this sample is built with .NET Core RTM and Preview 2 of the tools. 
When the tools are released, and updated version of the samples will be made available.
